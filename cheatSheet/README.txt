Hello!
It's me Ahmad Tariq
Here is BootStrap4.3 Cheat sheet named as "CheatSheet.html" you can find it in folder named as "BootStrap4"
In it there are CSS and Js folder too. these are for linking to .html file so just Clone the whole BooStrap4 folder and keep as it is and start seeing CheatSheet.html
Open it in any browser and here you go!

Thanks!
